# Contributing

Suggestions and pull requests are highly welcome! Please write the manifests in [recommended format](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-Ash258/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-write-manifests) for easy maintenance.

## Criteria

Manifests will accepted if it meets the following requirements:

- It doesn't already exists in [Scoop Directory](https://rasa.github.io/scoop-directory/by-apps).
- It exists in Scoop Directory, but its info (name, version...) is outdated or inaccurate.
- It exists in Scoop Directory, but it is a nightly version.

## Submitting to known buckets

We suggest you always submit the requests/manifests to the [known buckets](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/blob/master/buckets.json) as well. However, they may be rejected or take forever to be approved, and that's when Sushi comes in.

Please note, if you want to submit existing manifests from Sushi to the known buckets, make sure to leave a reference to Sushi.
